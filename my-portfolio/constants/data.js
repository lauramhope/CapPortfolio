    description: [
      `I'm a highly motivated individual with a strong problem-solving mindset, driven by a fervent passion for both continuous learning and innovative creations. I'm a recent graduate of Epicodus' full-stack development program with an extensive background in patient care. I'm excited to bring my skills in communication, teamwork, and problem solving to a new career in software development.`,
      `Before Epicodus, I was a practicing Physical Therapist where I assisted in the physical rehabilitation of people with various pathologies. During my time as a Physical Therapist, I provided excellence in patient care via utilizing my interpersonal skills and facilitating movement to optimize patient independence. While my time as a Physical Therapist was rewarding for my personal growth, I am pleased to have made the transition over to another field that will challenge me to problem-solve independent of patient care. 
      `,
      `Currently, I'm focused on refining my skills in React, C#, Next.js, and SQL. I'm eagerly looking forward to furthering my growth as a developer. Throughout my time at Epicodus, I have successfully completed numerous projects, ranging from simple word games to full-stack web applications. The experience has been immensely rewarding, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of expanding my skillset and taking on more ambitious projects in the future.`,
